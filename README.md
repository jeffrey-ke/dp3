TODOs

[] create training script.sh for Pooling + Downscaler experiments

[] Check simulation image rendering to capture hihg-res images
    [] Train baseline with DP3 encoder
    [] Train the best model from above 



Later
[] Obs['img'] vs obs["image"] - standardize everywhere
[] Removed ema model based gradient flowing : (error due to vggt model no_grad model)

[] Need better way to integrate VGGT
[] Other envs(Metaworld etc) need changes to work with observation dict!
